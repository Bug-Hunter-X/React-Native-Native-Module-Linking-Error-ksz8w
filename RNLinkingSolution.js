The solution involves verifying the native module is correctly linked for both iOS and Android.  

**iOS:**
1. **Check Podfile:** Ensure your Podfile includes the necessary pods for your native module.  Run `pod install` within the `ios` directory.
2. **Build Settings:** Verify that the required frameworks and libraries are included in your project's build settings.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Clean your project's build cache (using Xcode or the command line) and rebuild your application.

**Android:**
1. **Check `settings.gradle`:** Confirm the native module is included in your `settings.gradle` file.
2. **Check `build.gradle`:** Verify the module is correctly included as a dependency in your app's `build.gradle` file.
3. **Sync and Rebuild:** Sync your project with Gradle and rebuild your application.

If the issue persists, inspect the detailed error messages in the console. Often, a more specific error is buried within the initial error report.  You may also need to consult the documentation of the third-party library for platform-specific instructions.  The exact steps may vary depending on the native module you're using.
