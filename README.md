# React Native Native Module Linking Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-diagnose, error in React Native: failures in linking native modules.  The issue is often masked by unclear error messages, making debugging challenging.

The `RNLinkingError.js` file shows the problematic code, where the React Native application attempts to use a native module that is not properly linked.  `RNLinkingSolution.js` provides a potential solution and explanation of steps to resolve this.
